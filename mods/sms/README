== Sms

This Crabgrass mod allows users to opt-in to receive SMS notifications
when they receive a message, and respond directly via SMS.


== Usage

Install the clickatell Gem:
  $ gem install clickatell

Add to config/crabgrass.ENVIRONMENT.yml:
  enabled_mods:
    - sms

Create config/clickatell.yml:
  api_key:  YOUR_API_KEY
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD

Run SMS Migrations:
  $ ./script/generate plugin_migration
  $ rake db:migrate


== Note on SMS Gateways

Currently, only Clickatell is supported. There's no technical reason for
this, other than I'm already familiar with the API. To use a different
gateway, you'll have to write your own backend. But that's quite easy.
Take a look in lib/backends.
