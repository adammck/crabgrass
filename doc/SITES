See CONFIGURATION for how to configure sites.

== Custom strings for sites

See config/locales/sites/README for directions how to setup custom strings for different sites.

== Custom appearances for sites

If you want a site to be themable you have to create for it a CustomAppearance object in script/console like this:

my_site.custom_appearance = CustomAppearance.create!
my_site.save!

Several sites can share a custom appearance so you can replace the first line with this:

my_site.custom_appearance = other_site.custom_appearance

Finally, there's one big gotcha. If a site has no custom_appearance, the 'default' custom appearance will be used. The 'default' is the first available custom appearance. But if no custom appearances are available at all, then a blank one will be used instead.
