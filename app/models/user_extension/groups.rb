#  Everything to do with user <> group relationships should be here.
#
#  "memberships" is the join table:
#    user has many groups through memberships
#    group has many users through memberships
#
#  There is only one valid way to establish membership between user and group:
#
#    group.add_user! user
#
#  Other methods should not be used!
#
#  Membership information is cached in the user table. It will get automatically
#  updated whenever membership is created or destroyed. In cases of indirect
#  membership (all_groups) the database is correctly updated but the in-memory
#  object will need to be reloaded if you want the new data.
